  000-default.conf: "<VirtualHost *:8080>\n  # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that\n  # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating\n  # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName\n  # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to\n  # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this\n  # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.\n  # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.\n  #ServerName www.example.com\n  \n  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n  DocumentRoot /var/www/html\n  \n  # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,\n  # error, crit, alert, emerg.\n  # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular\n  # modules, e.g.\n  #LogLevel info ssl:warn\n  \n  ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n  CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n  \n  # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are\n  # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to\n  # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the\n  # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only\n  # after it has been globally disabled with \"a2disconf\".\n  #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf\n</VirtualHost>\n\n# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet"
